#YOU ARE A ROCK

Unconventional text-based rpg. You play as a rock buried deep beneath the ground.

A game about geology and learning how to program.

To play ensure python and curses are installed and callable from the command line, then:

>python main.py

Currently in beta-testing and awaiting deployment - Any feedback much appreciated!
